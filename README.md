# moodle-block_catalogue
Plug-in for the Learning Management System Moodle. Provides a visual and central place for a teacher to access everything he can use in his course (activities, reports, blocks, …) Frequently used items can be marked as favorites for quick access. Unless the teacher wants to delete or move an activity or block, he no longer needs to switch to editing mode.

A manager interface is included. There, managers can :
-	Edit the descriptions.
-	Edit the documentation links.
-	Hide or show items to the teachers.
